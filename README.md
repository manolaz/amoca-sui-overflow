# AMOCA: Alliance Modeling Of Climate Action Finance

**Harnessing the Sui ecosystem to revolutionize climate finance and accelerate global sustainability.**

Climate change demands urgent action, but financial barriers often impede progress. AMOCA bridges this gap by creating a decentralized alliance where capital meets innovation. Built on the Sui blockchain, our platform transforms how climate initiatives are funded, tracked, and scaled.

AMOCA (Alliance Modeling Of Climate Action Finance) unites governments, international organizations, private investors, and climate innovators in a transparent ecosystem powered by Web3 technology. Our platform enables:

- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Advanced modeling of climate initiatives from renewable energy to sustainable agriculture, providing clear insights into project feasibility and impact metrics
- **Decentralized Funding Mechanisms**: Streamlined investment flows with verifiable accountability through Sui's powerful object model
- **Global Accessibility**: Democratized access to climate financing for developing nations and grassroots innovators
- **Transparent Impact Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of project outcomes with blockchain-verified reporting

By leveraging Sui's secure, scalable infrastructure, AMOCA transforms climate action from aspiration to implementation—creating a financially sustainable path toward a climate-resilient future.

## 🚀 Sui Overflow Hackathon Submission

This project is our submission for the Sui Overflow Hackathon. We've built a decentralized application on the Sui blockchain to revolutionize climate finance through transparent, efficient, and collaborative solutions.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Climate Project Marketplace**: Browse, submit, and fund climate action projects
- **Impact Tokenization**: Convert climate impact into tradable assets using Sui's object model
- **DAO Governance**: Decentralized decision-making for project approvals and fund allocation
- **Multi-party Escrow System**: Secure and transparent funding mechanisms
- **Impact Verification Oracles**: Integration with real-world data sources for verification
- **Cross-chain Interoperability**: Bridge with Solana for expanded liquidity options
