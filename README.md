# AMOCA - Information Flow for Sui Move/Rust Programs

## Introduction

AMOCA is a comprehensive toolkit designed for analyzing, visualizing, and securing Sui Move and Rust programs. It leverages information flow analysis to provide developers with powerful insights into their code, helping to identify potential security vulnerabilities and optimize program structure.

## Key Features

### Analysis and Visualization

- **Call Graph Visualization**: Interactive diagrams showing the relationships between functions and modules in your Move/Rust code
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Track how information moves through your smart contracts
- **Dependency Mapping**: Visual representation of module dependencies and interactions

### Security Features

- **Vulnerability Detection**: Identify common security issues including:
  - Reentrancy vulnerabilities
  - Integer overflow/underflow
  - Authorization bypasses
  - Resource leakage
- **Security Audit Reports**: Comprehensive documentation of potential security concerns
- **Best Practice Recommendations**: Suggestions for improving code security based on established patterns

### Move Program Translation

- **Move to Rust Translation**: Convert Move programs to equivalent Rust implementations
- **Cross-language Interoperability**: Streamline interactions between Move and Rust components
- **Migration Assistance**: Tools to help port existing code to the Sui ecosystem

### Generative Features

- **Code Expansion Suggestions**: AI-powered recommendations for extending functionality
- **Template Generation**: Scaffolding for common Sui design patterns
- **Feature Enhancement**: Intelligent suggestions for optimizing existing code

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (version 1.60+)
- Sui CLI (version 1.0+)
- Node.js (version 16+) for the visualization components

### Installation
